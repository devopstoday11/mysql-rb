# mysql-rb

Native MySQL client in Ruby.

## Why

* No dependencies like libmysqlclient or mariadb-connector required
* Written in Ruby and easy to contribute to
* Works on any Ruby interpreter (yes, JRuby and no JDBC/ActiveRecord issues)
* Ready for async support

### TODO

* ~Connect and handshake~
* ~Execute queries~
* ~Parse resultsets~
* query escape
* session tracking
